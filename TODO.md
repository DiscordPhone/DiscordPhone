# TODO

- Fix when mobile hangs up before Discord
- Add Nexmo, cellsynt or ClockworkSMS API for sms
- enable incoming calls + get phone number for discord
- replace prints with python logger
- check if callerID(name()) works
- Improve blacklist.json + matching
- Check that specified config file exists

- Add Mic + Speakers for testing so we dont have to call every time we test the Discord Part, since phone works good now.

## Not prioritized
